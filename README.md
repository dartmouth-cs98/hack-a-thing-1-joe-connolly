# Pong Line Webapp 
### Description:
The Pong Line webapp is a simple CRUD app for keeping track of a pong line in a frat basement.

### Installation:
Clone the repository and navigate to its root folder. Install Mongodb and Node/Express following the linked tutorials below.  Then you should simply be able to start MongoDB and the Express app and navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to use the webapp. 

### Wnat I learned:
To build the app I followed the Express.js tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnsO8-xJ8rs 
For the MongoDb component I also followed instructions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKjH8WhSu_E 
I also deployed a sample Express app following the AWS tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubCNZRNjhyo
I had no experience with Express and AWS and only minimal experience with most other web development technologies - including MongoDB, so it was cool to gain an understanding of these popular technologies.  

### What didn't work:
While I was able to successfully deploy a sample Express app to AWS Beanstalk following the AWS tutorial and build and run my custom Express.js app locally, I was unable to deploy my custom Express.js app to AWS Beanstalk without getting 502 Gateway errors.  I decided it was best to focus my efforts on making my webapp look nice, even if it only ran locally.
